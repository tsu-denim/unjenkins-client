This repository is for unjenkins-client, a rest based thin-client that can read responses from [un-jenkins](https://github.com/tsu-denim/unjenkins)

### Whats so great about it? ###

* Provides a polished and easy to read dashboard for your Jenkins pipeline that can be proudly displayed on a big flat screen in your work area or just your desktop. 
* Client is very lightweight, should have no trouble powering a flatscreen with a raspberry pi.
* unjenkins-client provides an easy to read dashboard for build histories of Jenkins jobs.
* Dashboard refreshes automatically, or manually via hidden refresh button.
